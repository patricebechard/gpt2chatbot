PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 And this list includes the likes of:

Kobe's ex-wife and longtime girlfriend

A handful of LA Lakers fans on Twitter, such as @Bryant2LAC

A handful of LA Lakers fans on Instagram, such as @matthebarryman3

An entire team's twitter feed, such as @DLAbryant

This is my list of those who think "Kobe is still with the team" even though he's signed up to stay elsewhere.

I've done this survey for five years now and it is always a tough one because there are so many fans that feel differently.

But I think this list will make things easier for those that think Bryant is on his way out and that his time with the Lakers is now.

Let's start with the #1 fan who thinks so:

The #1 fan

I know you might be thinking: "I just don't care that much" or "Who cares? This isn't about me."

No, the #1 fan is me.

I'm here because I'm still a Lakers fan with the hope that he or she will be a member of the Lakers going forward.

To give you an idea of just how many people care about Bryant's return: the LA Times reported at this year's All-Star break there were more fan interviews with Bryant as the game went on than with any other player in the NBA. I believe this is because, at the moment Bryant and the Lakers need to win games to make the playoffs, it's their last stop before a trip to the NBA Finals.

Of those who care, the #1 fan has some interesting things to say:

So now you're saying you don't care about Kobe's return? Well then I guess it's not fair to those fans who care too.

If we don't show the Lakers that Kobe is still here, I think the fans on this list will. Kobe is still here and it's only fair that he gets that respect.

And for the rest of you fans in the world: don't ever forget that Kobe Bryant's time with the Lakers is never done.

#1 Los Angeles Lakers fan's list

As a fan of the Lakers, if you want Kobe Bryant's return, you are going to have to put him in your top five. But there's one question left unanswered – why?

What you have to understand, even if you want Kobe back, is this is a tough decision. The only person that can be asked to say that they are willing to do this is Kobe himself.

So if Kobe is ready, you better have the team back in the lineup for the playoffs. And if you don't think he or she is, then you'll have to ask the same question Kobe will probably ask himself: "What do they do?!"

I know, I knew you'd ask.

To everyone that has followed the Lakers for the last 5 years or so – and especially to anyone in the Los Angeles media who has followed the team all season – thank you.

To me, the only player that cares about winning is Kobe Bryant. Kobe does not care about the fans on the other side of the ball. He cares about winning – for himself and for his club, and that's a tough one to say.

As Kobe said when asked during last Friday's media day to discuss whether he wants to return for a fifth and FINAL season in LA, "That's not up to me."

Yes, in fact, his answer is: "Well, maybe."

As a fan of the team and as someone that is rooting against them, I think the fans of the Lakers are ready for Bryant to get back into the team. And that's not going to happen any time soon
