PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 
 It also indicated that the album may be a collaboration between Kanye West and rapper Kendrick Lamar.

The tracklist for Jesus Is King did not feature any major surprise guests, but it did feature a number of unexpected artists. A few of the names listed on this new tracklist include: Migos, DJ Snake, The Chainsmokers, and Lil Uzi Vert.

Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar have collaborated before, although Kanye performed at his friend Kanye West's Yeezus tour, the "Summer of Love," back in September 2011. Kendrick has also performed at several Kanye West-hosted shows over the years; in March of 2015 he performed at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.

Yeezy is currently working to put out his first album, The Life of Pablo’, which features the tracks "Gold Digger," "Izzo," "All Day," and "Wolves in the Throne Room." It is likely that the upcoming LP will be called Yeezus 2.
