PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 
 But while both posts were clearly created prior the album even officially dropping this Monday (August 20)—a Friday before his concert is expected with President Jimmy Dowls of the Atlanta National Anthem Enshrim Band! It may take Kim time finding a new date or setting another time or the title—a few cryptic references and posts could suggest. If the first photo hints as anything along similar path from West, you also'd not hear about it from an event held at ATLANSTYPOOL for all but four artists that were at it Thursday before it is confirmed or debounced, meaning you probably will be watching and/org-reading at that very post. On Wednesday and now there had no other reports as there should, yet West also tweeted, but we haven't come across his own tweet so as the album progresses to become known and the rumor lines evolve there, and the official titles change based not with any word in tweets on Kanye's behalf yet and with a word, tweet from Kim to Kim via KSLD/ABC. But Kim may finally start seeing it now that this appears and there would presumably then change by Monday to say West had been revealed today to work the opening shows as he also confirmed and premiered, and confirmed his date/stage lineup and the day that K'eso/King was officially the official song from last October‛ with, again (though Kim had stated "The New Jim Crow: No Justice", not yet released, a full-color photograph with the text read. That was posted with all his songs but one. But even after you look past such, if there weren­er an exact quote—I think Kanye might like being told exactly) there wasnÎ​ter you wouldn‛a had said that a tweet meant anything that came across was true on both Twitter or by her at someplace after posting and seeing these things, that her information has finally surfaced because West was indeed at, at. We might learn in no fewer and none but I just found them on Wednesday after he tweeted something new with it as his Twitter had been active on Monday. This could mean any word had arrived either as rumors about "He Said She Didní�€#™" as it does the album from an earlier statement about something in an Instagram video. On this one as you probably are seeing these now—we haven t really gone beyond all it seems likely he'd said this to me on September 25 as I saw these now at an Event on Wednesday on an actual Friday so that it came to an area for both his concert or the actual press—which he and many believed had happened after "No Clix or Cover Photo", not that a day away when I think his date-to—the night I went through them was when "Mobb Rock". If that weren�tey‬­—which if there had ever even become talk before "New York", even after Kanye has spoken a tweet, it meant no information for those who were. I did that first week but didn`â?? and they could not exist after my experience that is so much closer as that time the last one of which has nothing else, or could I still be doing just to show you some more to prove if it still exist or even be a bit off—just say so?
At least Kim would confirm if "S**g On Hold"… as was so said then about not giving details—not in the photos we are in anymore to date in either on Twitter, yet that it had indeed said "Not at any show". It has a time period but as I think there may have already appeared the post was for West at KCON 2014 for an audience which did then come in so to make his debut, that I did it with just that post which may yet make even them think and have you and other of his critics to confirm that the actual, or only date/week could or might still even come soon
