PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 


A small group of those fans is led by Lakers fans themselves. The group has gathered at a bar recently and have been talking about what to do next for Kobe. As you can see from the photo above, there are a number of people talking about how they would vote for Bryant to come back to the Lakers next season. And what do they say?

If the rumors of a Kobe Bryant return are true, then you can guess who among the Lakers' core would be the most likely to come back — Jordan Clarkson.

Jordan Clarkson has been on the losing end of a lot of things over the past couple of years with the Lakers, most notably not making it out of the first round of the 2014 Draft in the 2014 NBA Draft. At the time of the rumors, he had just finished his rookie year in college as a top prospect — where he averaged 11.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game.

A trade would probably be just to help the Lakers get a better return on Bryant if he does return. The Lakers need to find some cap space, but if the Lakers are going to get back to the playoffs, Clarkson will be a huge part of what they do this coming season. He's going to become a leader in the locker room and be a key cog behind the Lakers' second unit.

Now, if there were no talk of a return, that would be one thing. However, as the rumors have developed and have gained the interest of many, this idea of Clarkson returning to the Lakers is gaining steam — but not just from the Lakers organization.

As you see in the second photo above, the same man who is sitting next to Jordan Clarkson, is sitting on both sides of the debate of whether or not Jordan Clarkson should come to the Lakers next season.

Lakers fans are the ones saying he should come, but the fans on each side of the debate say he should stay in Charlotte. If the rumors turn out to be correct — and they will turn out to be — then there may be some fans who want to take this one step further, and if this rumor is true, it would be the ultimate statement on the subject.

What do you think, Lakers fans? Should Jordan Clarkson have left the team last season?
