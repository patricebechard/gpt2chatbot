PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 That will only happen because of one guy who might just get to be an L.A. fan in the NBA's futureâ€¦and maybe it would take years and months before he does get a taste.<|endoftext|>This page requires Javascript. You may click to download or install it at your choice here: http://tiny.cc/c8zcxg


Welcome, the second article on this website in two days!

If there's a word or wordless word in this dictionary it might refer to some other type of words which we think is useful to remember about our language or something related, but are probably unnecessary in order to remember the word you've chosen for a moment or in a longer term to describe an idea we're having now. For now I hope that this dictionary makes you think.


It has only taken the time it took to type this word for me a week of research before finding one or both definitions that I felt useful, so feel free to share this post with us your experiences with these two words, and also, with the meaning of other words that have to be added in the next weeks of translation for me, as I'll need those to get things started in time!

So here I'm writing what it says and then you have a better understanding on what the word is! And this may mean a couple days until a complete list will come!<|endoftext|>It's official!

On the last of March I finally found out about a new game on Steam and, with its title being a "dubbed RPG, a first for Nintendo 3DS, the team has decided not to let me spoil what the title actually means," said a Nintendo press rep at the time. The only details, in our interview with Nintendo president and creative director Shigeru Miyamoto in June 2014 (in Japanese with no translation for publication here): The title of the upcoming sequel to Final Fantasy is not, however, yet announced, with no release dates set yet (but I'm assuming the Japanese release for now would be this June) or even release in a few more territories (such as America). And as always we are awaiting Nintendo of Japan's latest announcement from us. I still believe we need the "final word," but as with almost any title we may receive some new details over time (we have had this conversation before) as we prepare our first big game, Final Fantasy Type-0! (For now this blog has the full version and translations with translations of many other pieces as well: Japanese version)<|endoftext|>It appears that one or two of these are the first few lines that I added (it might even be that all these lines came later). There seems to be another, even bigger issue at stake when using an old school style font, especially with such large amounts of space for each word on one sheet! And that, unfortunately is how some people are able to miss their words, while the other half, when using an alternative type font, doesn't see all their characters! I think some of those lines that you may see, have some pretty obvious spelling errors!

Some words were in different sections of this page, so the next to last words are not part of each chapter and some pages have some missing sections in the bottom row or left. This can mean you didn't click on that part of an old school type font which might be what's going wrong in this image (this happens often!).

Also some people seem to find the spacing in certain characters quite difficult to read because some letters (the lower part is not really spaced, just a small portion) have a gap of some small area behind that portion and when looking down the row for letters a lot of space may have appeared in one of those spaces.<|endoftext|>A woman whose husband is on suicide watch, says his body language suggested a break.
