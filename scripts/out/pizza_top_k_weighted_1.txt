PROMPT :
If you’re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza that’s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as you’re gonna get at home.

COMPLETION : 
 The perfect thin crust pizza is what is usually referred to as, the crustless one. The crust is cut out very thin with a dough roller in the oven and tossed with a little sugar and salt that gets baked into a crust. In this low fat, low carb pizza dough, we make the crust in the oven instead of at the table or at home, so you can have the pizza that makes you feel like a king.
The Best Part: No Bake Pizza Dough
It is the perfect crust without the risk of burning your skin, and all the better because it is easy to prepare in less time. For those of you that love dough dough, this is the recipe for you. No other thin crust pizza you've ever made is that quick and easy! It even allows you to get the best taste of pizza toppings and the right texture. The dough is soft and easy but still crispy on the edges, perfect for a thin crust. If you're feeling more adventurous, I also recommend you try out this low fat pizza dough recipe for a really crispy crust at home.
