PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 


The rapper's name popped up multiple times on the photo's description, including the first mention of Kanye's real name on the album, "Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 2." The tracklist was a bit confusing, with no mention of his album title—a first for Kanye—and an inclusion of a guest on the track, which was clearly Kim from G.O.O.D Music, who performed on a track on Kim's album.

"We're not just going to be on the same album with all these girls," Kim wrote via Twitter at the time. "[T]hen we get closer, we're gonna work harder, we're gonna be more focused on each other. Just because we're on different labels doesn't mean we can't work together, we can work together, but you got to have your own label."

This is definitely the direction Kim wants to take, as she has been in the limelight in recent years. During 2015's Grammys, Kim was nominated for her album, "I Am," which hit number one on Billboard's Hot HipHop Songs chart, and in 2016, she and Kanye attended "The X Factor" in Miami, where Kanye was also nominated. Kim's debut studio album, the self-titled A Star Is Born, also won Billboard's Best Rap Album award. That album also features the title track, and included guests Kanye West and Jay Z.

With the album release date now in a matter of months, will Kanye West's follow-up to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, titled Yeezus, feature any collaboration with the now-famous "real kid?"

"He's very talented, and I don't think he's really gonna want to work with anybody that is going to be his friends or like, 'Hey, let's make some money on here.' He's too much of a star already, too well connected to that. I think he wants to have something with people that he knows, and that he's connected to, and that he can just hang out with, because he's got a lot of money. He's gonna be really close with some of the younger artists around him."

This is definitely something new for Kanye. He's always been involved at all points of his career. As recently as 2014, K-Pop star, Kim So Hyun, shared a similar story to Kanye.<|endoftext|>For all my years, my first love has been the art of making the ultimate party game (see also: The Ultimate Boggle, a Game of War). When I started to dabble in games in 2008, I really missed it. I had to learn the hard way that making a game and putting it out is a different beast than doing a good job of selling the game to people. I'm glad I got out of that business because it took me away from the art of making art that I loved.

Now that I'm a full time game developer and game journalist/publisher, I've been working on a project called Tasty: The Art of Making Games in a Digital Age. This project has me focusing on game art because you need to be able to say things, write things and talk about things and have a wide range of skills to write an engaging story. The most important skill for that isn't making music in your garage or writing a novel and publishing to print but writing a story, a good story, that has depth and meaning that people care about. I need to give my game developers/publishers and fans/players of games an accessible and high level of information that's easy to read, understandable and entertaining to read.

The first book to be released will be an introduction to the field of "game art for the digital age" and the first book will be an illustrated introduction to game art made by two teams with different background styles. The artists behind this book will also
