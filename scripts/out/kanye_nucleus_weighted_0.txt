PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 
 "We've all had those crazy nights. But there are still so many more. It will all finally end with a big bang, just like that," it reads, with "God Save the Queen." It's been less than four years since The Game released the "Father Stretch My Hands" beat in a series of singles and an accompanying EP (with "No More Parties In Las Vegas") on Def Jam in June, and West is about to get a fresh perspective on life outside of music — even while the world finds its focus elsewhere on Twitter. "Kanye is about the most amazing, crazy man that I ever knew," his daughter Kylie recently tweeted in response. "That shit is the most dope ever!" Kanye was just talking with Kim on an upcoming appearance in LA. Watch that here.

"I'm so happy we could finally have our lives back in our own, independent and healthy way," says the King's latest record with West — "Gold Digger" is his debut studio record. In it he rapped about how he and Kanye spent time as teenagers, his first encounter in an adult world of fame (which they're both aware was a dream of sorts, despite a rocky first few years back). And after some soul searching — the album title, for instance — he finds it is still time. "[W]e all just kind of got it together to kind of make an album in 2017 that wasn't like, you know? It felt so like our first, first, year, we thought maybe if this came in this kind of a slow time with so little excitement then I don't feel so bad, but this year has been like an incredible whirlwind with just everything that has been happening, like the release, you know, everything going so good with my life being really successful with people telling my stories all of these crazy things going down," West told us back on October 26 at the Grammys, shortly before revealing Kanye and Yeezy made "The College Dropout 2," which became their only single (on Yeezus in particular, where Yeezus won five awards), but didn't win an Emmy for the Best Rap Solo/Album Album (which they did in "All of the Lights" on January 26, and he didn't mention his win as being his most valuable moment of success), "like he had an incredible success going all the time, it's almost kind of ironic," West tells The Verge of Kanye, "He's doing these projects that were so big at the same time and we all are." "But like we've always had to fight to be the first." In that respect it's fitting, in terms of timing — it feels fitting. In January 2015, it seems a decade to date since Kim released Kanye and West, the most celebrated pair in rap today — with "Wake Up", released at a moment that marked Kanye West and The Life Of Pablo as the most exciting duo, both at that — while at that point both sides were just two men on the path towards success (both with huge expectations that had no basis, to their satisfaction) with one album, the release of an equally monumental track "I.C.U., 2.2K." on Kanye West's Watch the Throne 2 in the year of 2016, and a new Kanye/Werk project, which he was already involved on in 2017 before dropping The College Dropout. It would only come two months after that in early November 2015 (and just one year to date, when the Kanye and Kim/West "Yeezy II." single came out.) Both projects came at a point in which there's almost never such clarity as that between artists. "And to just get to where he and I, when we had so much more success as young adults, was, like it seems like right before we did, a different point. And like, the more things you accomplish — you make something cool with
