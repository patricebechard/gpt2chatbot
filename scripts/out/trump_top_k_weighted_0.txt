COMPLETION : 
 Trump told NBC News he plans to release his tax returns and release his tax returns and I guess this is what they call a political payoff. Trump announced that during his speech in Phoenix that he would release his tax returns if the FBI doesn't release them by November 26th. Trump told NBC News in the Oval Office that he will reveal his returns sometime between his 60th birthday on November 23rd, 2027 and December 2026. The New York Times reports that, when asked who is going to get $10 million if Trump releases his taxes, he joked: "He has a great deal of money. Maybe he can find someone who will pay for it. That's what we're going to do." He added "I have no interest in having to worry about tax returns with the Russians." He added that if he releases his tax returns he will release his tax returns and that will be that.

Trump has been accused of not paying taxes on $150 million he received from Russia while at the helm of the real estate company. The president has said that he did pay the taxes on the money he received from the Russian state, but said that he will release some of the tax records once they come out. It appears that he will release his tax returns once he is elected.

In December 2006, Trump received his first $100 million loan from Bank of Russia. After it paid off he loaned out another $150 million, which was repaid with interest. Bank of Russia loaned again, the third round of interest was less than $30 million, the bank's total loan was $400 million at the end of 2006. This time Trump decided that he would take a $350 million loss on that loan.

When he went bankrupt last August, he reported that it was worth $650 million but that he would have to make a down payment for a $2.5 billion real estate loan to repay the loans. Trump had previously stated that he and his wife, Melania, would pay no interest on their $1.45 billion mortgage. In 2010 he reported $900 million owed to his bank but no payments were made, which led many to believe he had failed to pay his loan. But Trump later stated, "I payed them back."

In March, Trump took to Twitter to announce that the $1.3 billion loan he had secured from Bank of Russia would be paid off, although the terms of the loan, which was reported to be an interest rate of 4%, had been reduced to 3%. In September 2010 he received another loan from Bank of Russia from the Trump Foundation. Again, when it was due he announced that he would need $10 million. Trump repaid the loan in 2015, but it came with a lower interest rate. In September 2015 the Trump Foundation reported $2.7 billion in revenue from its charitable work. In May 2016, reports indicated that the Trump Institute at Trump Tower in New York had raised $4 million. However, a new report indicated that the Trump Foundation had not reported those funds to the IRS, despite claims that it did.

The Trump Foundation has paid out only $2.4 million in the last three years.

In January, Trump announced that he was withdrawing the US from the Iran-Contra Affair and that the White House was moving forward with a comprehensive Iran strategy. That strategy includes pressuring and pressuring the Iranian government to reverse its nuclear aspirations. Trump's move will be critical to stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, which the international community views as a threat to their security. This new initiative is consistent with what Trump stated in 2015 when he said: "The Iran-deal is not the right one. It's a bad deal … I don't like it, I don't like it…. I'm a skeptic." This is a move that most would agree with as it will put America and Israel's interests first.

In December 2010,
