PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 


"My mom and my uncle always used to say, 'You can only stay in this town if your brother is in the Lakers.' And then that was one of them guys!" said Kevin Love. "It always just made you want to say to [Miles] or [Bojan] that I could come here and be a part of something, to come back and win titles."

This may seem extreme but Love said the same about his own relationship with Kobe Bryant, which included the "bachelor" dating rumors that rocked the Laker front office just a few months after the Lakers hired him to replace the recently departed Kevin Durant in the 2012-13 season.

"They made a deal," Love explained of how his uncle and Lakers owner, Charles Barkley, convinced Bryant to go over and marry his girlfriend, Kourtney Kardashian, after Kobe told Bryant in 2012 that he had no intention of returning to the Lakers.

"I thought he'd be like, 'No, I just want to stay at home, I know you love me. I want to be with you every day,'" he said. "But he really took it to a whole new level. There are a lot of guys that go through that. And I think Kobe was just so happy."

Love has not only been a Laker, but has also become an international icon for the organization in ways no one, including Bryant himself, would ever want to be a part of.

"The only guy who ever made me feel better is Kobe," Love said of how the Lakers' front office handled the controversy regarding Kobe's relationship with his ex-lover, Khloe Kardashian. "They let me say whatever I wanted.

"What's wrong with being a professional sportsman? Just be a professional sportsman. It's been my biggest thing for the past six, seven years."<|endoftext|>We're on vacation in Australia for one week so this article is about an interesting country in a weird country. A town, a city and its own country. The town is called "Woolley" and its official website describes it:

Woolley is located about 35 miles west of Canberra, the capital of Australia. The town is part of the Northern Territory, which comprises parts of Western Australia and New South Wales, and Victoria. The town, about 1,200 hectares (2,400 acres), is situated between the coast of WA and the Darling Downs in the state's eastern seaboard. About 5 kilometres (3 mi) offshore is another town called "Valdis Hill".

But it also is the most beautiful town in the world. In this post we want to take a look at how the residents of Woolley got so beautiful.

The residents of Woolley are beautiful people, and we are going to take a look at what it is that makes them so fascinating. But first – you must understand what the most beautiful people in the world are.

The most beautiful people in the world

We are going to talk about the most beautiful people in the world, or those people that are most highly regarded, and also the most respected for their ability to be admired. The most admired? Well… you guess it! The second most wanted, the third highest preferred (in this case), the fourth highest liked (again – you guess it!), and the 5th highest liked highest would probably be people who, if you ask them to put themselves in a room with someone from the outside world, won all the time, so the question they would give would probably be, "What would happen if I put myself in the rooms with someone who's less famous?"

So that's what you see on the first page of this article.

The most highly respected.

And the most highly wanted – a city

Now I am a great admirer of the city I live
