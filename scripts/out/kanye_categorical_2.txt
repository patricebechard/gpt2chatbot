PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 
 Yeezy's first studio LP, The Life of Pablo‛ which is now available on iTunes™, is slated to drop on September 30.

Kardashian's tweet warned the fans reading her Facebook post to read everything that came before it. She asked Korean fans to stop what they were doing, stop lapping acts, and understand the context. "If you don't know anything, I'll let you in on a secret thing. I will no longer be keeping 20-20 mixes," she reassured. Seeing her posts in the Korea media, Kanye tweeted that he would be guest lecturing on the experience of East Coast rapper G-Unit.<|endoftext|>Ottawa police are investigating a series of bullet holes in various locations across Canada as dogs and: giant furry, bipedal inflatable and padded walking traps gather media attention for tumors under their noses.

Assistant Chief Dave Lewis, 38, said police were called October 25 to Westmount Avenue North near the Park Street Trail at Ténéréault in Whitby for reports of mostly natural and diseases in Heron Park. Lewis and other police officers from Westmount also combed through several properties south of the park.

He said within an hour neighbors started sharing complaints about automatic violence or intrusions of dogs into homes. Hoarders once again awaited the arrival of dogs and ran lots, keeping insects, rodents and seed offerings stashed under their boots and boots howls. Hostages, too, issued the dogs alarm calls to the nightly officer organized patrols.

Lewis said Monday afternoon police first learned that in addition to heart infections, seizures, leg pains, eczema, constipation and mind problems dog bites could be causing outside their homes. Without sufficient insurance or veterinary aid it is worth interviewing owners of dogs who seem to be a danger.

Station manager Kim Caladze said Canada Post cronically reported to them someone paid $800 for a single file designation dog. When they obtained the auditor that presented the paper Caladze said they read that they were temporarily assisting with lost mail, but there was nothing to indicate otherwise. When asked again post office officials released that $800 per square foot item becomes unavailable as long as out rolls continue postage is approved and any remaining funds postponed until a dog owner approves impounding.

Caladze would not speculate on the noise all of police officers heard that morning beyond: "It's definitely noticeable."

According to badges, there was approximately $25,000 in total dog bites and a police spokesperson told courts $4 million was owed to dog rescuers and the city and provinces.

Ted and John say that Washington must pay their debt obligations for the ships, planes, and bridges it has already purchased – whether guard money or Planned Parenthood money.

Please stand with our Ohio Shippers who must clean up burden of government waste and we pledge to press Capitol Hill $5 to throw the debt ceiling fight out of the GOP party.

Under Barack Obama, federal borrowing is up a yet incalculable number, reaching $16 trillion. We oppose Democrats claiming baby and college kids get especially from leading a generation.

If Congress doesn't budge either on wildlife and environmental legislation or the need to clean up Katrina, winding down a continuing resolution cuts monies spent and force fear and distractions into families, businesses and communities.

Our motto is universal acknowledgment and responsibility. If Congress close our eyes and graphic, idiotic kids, they'll happen. See our Rick Santamaria for your Sun Monitor $5 for opportunity to vote Republican! What's to stop Obama or Democrats like Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi
