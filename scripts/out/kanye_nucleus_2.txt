On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye Westâ€™s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27.

"So far Kanye has done all these different stuff so there was really only 1 release for the last two weeks that wasn't Kanye or Jay," he said in another tweet.

But as The Wrap detailed last year, this album wasn't exactly what Kanye and West hoped. "We know they don't feel like this," The Post said then, noting it is "an effort for the artist who can write the album without being in their wheelhouse and the producer whose vision would never happen if there's a lack of creative vision in his or her studio or even a lack of interest from fans. This is a record by one person with a few years to make the album and that one person's vision is all Kanye could bring. But there was one big mistake they were not prepared for." Kanye is scheduled for an Aug. 30 release show with the Rolling Stone festival and his YEEZY Mane debut on September 29. Kanye's album was announced by a mysterious email with his official album number (XXladegal.co), his "Hands up if you rapping," quote on it.<|endoftext|>A man who claimed the woman raped him after an altercation over an unpaid debt, is facing three years jail and up to 12 years behind bars, according to court documents.

Michael J. Smith of Westbury was ordered Thursday on all charges including rape, armed kidnapping and kidnapping of a person by kidnapping by unlawful taking and kidnapping and robbery, among others charges against his victim in a case stemming from her complaint of sexual assault. He appeared Thursday and will enter no plea during a pretrial intervention.


His case comes at an emotional moment as Newbury Police Commissioner Robert A. Wardsill said the incident started out "good but then morphed from being about money into something very wrong," in that woman said he repeatedly touched her in the stomach. Smith also said the victim later threatened to shoot and killed his family in their car during what turned out to have been a sexual assault that turned deadly.


Police on Sept. 10 received an anonymous call alleging Smith forced an employee out of his Newbury business on a sidewalk at 7th Avenue, police say, and a police investigation soon turned up the woman's account of Smith. She was a customer. She had no idea she would soon go public, but had a vague account that a woman, also an employee of Smith, pulled the woman aside. When the victim didn't give them consent, he forced the victim and employee out and left the car, police said, which led Smith into Westbury, the woman and other witnesses who later identified them were in, the report says. Police searched a vehicle for drugs after Smith fled.


According to police and a preliminary report filed by prosecutor Robert J. Wills Jr. Smith told authorities he "was upset about an outstanding unpaid credit balance." The woman reported the man forced the woman, then herself out of his building after she left.

Wills did not identify who called him that afternoon or when, although police told him a neighbor saw Smith on surveillance tape outside, a crime the police have linked with his business and which led police to a warrant to search a van the night before in Newbury to "find weapons, evidence or drugs" found near his house and the suspect car that Smith stole in that car was used in Smith's robbery. Smith was arrested after Wardsill said the investigation was complicated, as Wardsill told the newspaper "I just want everyone in here, all those in our business, to know we had something very wrong on this evening that is going to continue and it could turn violent in Newbury as we have." Police have no charges pending against the employee or his victim. Wardsill did say that Wills has talked about his concern with victims "every chance I have, every minute and every moment." Smith was being held without bond. He remains behind bars at the State Parole Authority at
