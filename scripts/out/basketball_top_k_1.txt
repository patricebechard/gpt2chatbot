PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 There won (mostly by fan votes). They've seen Bryant get through two and one quarter seasons before and have his reputation well entrenched among NBA players throughout all eras to play his final seasons with them — so even after watching and reading through countless reports that point more strongly back then to that reality with Lakers general managing general talent and ownership looking like mad cats. We all knew the future couldn (will?) never truly belong one individual over two more, though he's just that gifted the first thing any coach should aim when recruiting.

 for that alone I would feel sorry about not letting it out loud as long and it wasn-

 and in anycase what happens today doesnot come here but this has been something everyone's heard more and heard different as I write but my favorite recent story coming up has a player, someone whose age probably shouldn´ti- the thing everyone who follows this thing would say, just doesnnt ring hollow with a new era of talent entering its third year since 2011 and another of that era and that is not exactly an environment or environment to say this one will get out for real and get the work it wants it, at long most will get what's it want for him (and hopefully this is the thing he just couldn?tty give that will change and he might?ti not see or not see how great his new position for another organization can get for his time here- his first year of relevance for the franchise that is already at what looks an average-sized payroll) in 2016– if only, and not for long if not because then again who am that, not the players he gets it or him and his position but more of something, not as if there will?nt ever (though if nothing ever happens it still does take one at most) be the reason I have nothing I should ever talk much more than how awful I have a hard-won, much longer legacy- in-and to do I would also love someone as humble but more to love of a coach at just 30 in years 2 – 21? or the way things could, just maybe in 2 seasons a bit before they all become part, if just a touch too- too. so I feel more the like if anything a few are already doing the impossible because even those people still know something he would still give to this group the very day I start asking to get an autoxcope on some stuff we saw yesterday because who doesnai?) still don'thing, it is simply impossible that any will?tra, if not in all their current capacity at just 26 I mean for that also as for those players the question would? not ring too big if only and for this I mean this and I would rather the time he does nothing in this team but do something- for he could never really- and that isnot just be because now his position was, and if just to a little, something which could help this club win something even the most basic kind even then that. if I would it for them- this isn´tt a small or not to be the same.<|endoftext|>(WGN - Baltimore News Institute file photograph courtesy Ofo.)

Srinasan Sr) This article does so by examining a simple comparison with how people from across our globe can understand someone else by using similar symbols – with symbols like these, people around India may use "kundhau-gurudu";

The Indian people and language language is the source from a certain period into one era but with this period in that particular land that is being explained today, may very
