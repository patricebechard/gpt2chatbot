PROMPT :
If youâ€™re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza thatâ€™s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as youâ€™re gonna get at home.

COMPLETION : 
 You're gonna get exactly the dough right, youâ€–ll feel great and not hungry at night and your kids are happy at your expense because your pizza will get their fix every time you take out their mouth-melting treats (and no more pizza). It also won't turn out anything fancy at allâ€–â€“no cheese.

This thin- crust crust is easy enough, you donâ€•t need fancy toppings; but don't worry about those fancy things. The best thing is it has some good, thick pizza-breath, the only time this is not a great idea (unless the crust has too much doughy substance that causes a doughnut crust, or just makes this one less than optimal.) The thin-crusted pizza will always come together very quickly without having to add more time (and you will also find out your kid really enjoys this thin-crusting crust, just like we love mine too). You know your child is gonna love that too. I donâ€•t care where it came from either. ThatÊ¿ll give a nice hint and the crust â€™could â€ªt be more easy and fun, it would also get you over the hump so the dough is still coming out of it! (See whatâ€’aâ€° I did thereâ€±?â€°.) This is the ideal, quick pizza-breath crust dough. No need to worry if your dough is a bit thicker; it won â€²t make it â€¯theâ€¹ time â€³itÊ’ was thick and sticky like a thick cookie dough. If that makes your mind â€­okayâ€¬ up to some pizza crust-y, go right ahead; it can only get more difficult from now until next Sunday night â€°because youÊœ are just getting the hang of pizza crust and not pizza at large, or maybe pizza-dish-making. And youâ€–ve probably done that, maybe with an actual dough recipe from someone like you. (Or at home you may still think that way about me but I just can â€°t believe we didn't make our crust as simple or even with all-enveloping sauceâ€¹ as this pizza has toâ€°).

When this thick doughy pizza was in a dough shop a year back when they would use thin, airtight containers of pizza-flavors they would give a little sauce and cheese as well, which was wonderful; itâ€–s kind of an alternative way to serve dough if the pizza wouldâ€¯be too salty, salty and tangy with that sauce-cheesy topping or cheese. ThatÊ»s how my wife, sister, and I love making pizzas, that is all, we're making all pizzas at the restaurant or making pizzas outâ€°, we have some kind of special sauce/chips in hand (like homemade mozzarella cheese) when our dough dough has finished cooking (in fact the last few nights that it took a whole pizzeria a weekâ€¹ and was a little thinâ€­). (That isâ€­the reason you want that thin-crusting pizza crust at your party! If not, then maybe make the pizza a week earlier and freeze your sauce. Just in case). I donâ€•t like that it can be so messy. I also find I prefer my dough crust that thick, when in doubt and it will always have my sauce in the dough or the toppings and toppingsâ€­, so that I will not waste extra pizza sauce on toppings when my pizzaâ€»is finished. The only times it really has extra stuff are at night when your kids have a hard time getting out, if it doesn't make its way down into the pan it
