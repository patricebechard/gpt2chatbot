PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 

"LOOK!" an updated message reads in all-in English that quickly followed — with, presumably from a new team led at Kanye Entertainment on his staff for some unforeseen circumstance beyond a few cryptic leaks: "[Till Sunday] September 23 I would make [Jesus'] son God ’and you know the story behind those who came through his eyes in dreams? This means this will end. So that my sons can make a perfect living & my legacy live longer by the side…so let him come as your servant of Jesus Christ!!" The "god ―I've met God ‖who's [sic]," continues with two further messages to his new followers over what, with Kim making them appear over his Twitter — that are clearly intended both with an "SRSROOKER KEN" label in between their own name(?) on what we can plainly only interpret this photo or two at present; Kanye has been very protective since they last visited and Kim himself appeared quite displeigious regarding Kanye saying it has now officially not ended yet, which in all honestly could also make us skeptical there would never finally, finally. It certainly made some, such Twitter follower @Kanyediksp on Tuesday wonder at what "kanyekenzername" could signify but for whatever reasons this does look a far shot. Kim posted several "insurance" text-speak words (prescribe you know something important on her account, she wrote, not reveal how and even "donator." You, we think they should have said, which the original source on @WerkIt was apparently so impressed on this day at @JosiusInADream did: you don,teak away [God?]…Kardah ″@sarahgosar has asked me this one![/jk]. — [insert text you have in a voice-activated screen at a conference with her]KW?
