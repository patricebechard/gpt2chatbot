PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 It may be time, in our hearts for him, that this year was a special Kobe year to finally bring his legacy and his legacy of success back. It won't take an entire offseason and a handful of moves in a draft to turn him around. He needs to put all this baggage to one side. If only this would be Kobe's last year, this might actually be an idea to see Kobe come back, and see how far we're going. Maybe even for all the other reasons I listed here. If Bryant doesn't do something different with that contract (i.e., play harder this next year), that would only add further weight to Kobe Bryant rumors that we'll never be able to disprove. If it takes him years, we have some good candidates on his way back in time for a good shot to the championship next year if Kobe can stay on that same trajectory he was at with LA Lakers and the Clippers.

The only problem? The Mamba is a guy we all wish Kobe was as a young Kobe was as an established legend in LA Lakers lore and culture. There's nothing we can say right now. What will it be that turns it all around in a way Kobe fans won't believe will happen when all is said and done, Kobe Bryant doesn't show up, there will be a Kobe comeback that turns the team around, but will we all live up to what it once promised to Kobe Bryant fans when this is his last chance to make us proud as a fanbase, as opposed to alluding it would never come and the whole Lakers season ends in tears like everyone has for the entire last few weeks in our beloved City of Los Angeles and that we never will again. So for the last 15 months or more that have passed since the Mamba died off and his legacy finally gets put to bed. Let this year serve as just an intro to this next phase and it all will fall together. But when I hear people mention this I start to feel that all the rumors, all these whispers will finally catch fire and Kobe's back to playing his heart out. There will never again be the Kobe who never does. Kobe will do something new next season and the people in attendance are excited by this idea and by what's been rumored over and over for a long while. He just never seems like it when the game is in play anymore and his mind races. So for every year he doesn't come to Staples Center to celebrate his 30 years on a great franchise the team gets another opportunity, but in return the fan is treated to Kobe being back for an exciting season of free agents that may not be quite so exciting once more the Mamba leaves and everything gets turned on the fan in some small but tangible way that could mean all sorts of good. Let me get into some specific points that would bring some closure for this next part in his career as the player everyone was clamoring about but couldn't get enough about:<|endoftext|>The first-person shooter that started a franchise will launch exclusively on Sony and Microsoft systems at no cost in a bundle with The Amazing Spiderman.

The game has been announced with no other specific information yet about when its official debut is scheduled or on a PlayStation Store. The game will have PlayStation All Access for its PSN debut this summer, so fans are getting some pretty nice exclusives from the game as part of its $80.

In other PlayStation Now goodness, there are three prequel movies for Sony's PS3 that fans of the movies might actually want. All of them can also be played offline without buying the game, according to GameSpot's Justin Holmes. You don't have to worry about getting your hard drive smashed if you choose the "Online play and sharing with others only available to PS Now Pass Members and Platinum Members."

A lot of PlayStation All Access subscribers already have PlayStation Plus subscribers with their existing titles as the free trials are ending, meaning this deal makes Sony all-important
