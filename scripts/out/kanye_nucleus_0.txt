PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27.

"It sounds crazy. My favorite music of the past five or six months was The Black Eyed Peas‚and there are some very close associates," wrote Kardashian. She noted she "always felt like The Black Eyed Peas' last song 'Dookie'' sounded like one of her own lyrics," but the rapper has yet to officially release "Jesus is king," though there was no way for them not to work on something, especially given his popularity on social networks such as Twitter, which are where rumors first began about an announcement on the music label. The Black Eyed Peas has released their fourth full-length, "All I Ever Was'' in September 2016 and were also signed by Jay Z and Rihanna in February and April respectively for "Jesus Is King.'' The project has reportedly had "several collaborators."

The U.S.P.&TR filing reveals how wearable technology, especially connected to a mobile app and in-vehicle monitoring, might help consumers better control, manage, protect or control devices of all shapes and sizes without the necessity to keep their fingers or thumbs tethered in an increasingly electronic age.

The U.S. Patent filing for an electronic wristband includes several different kinds of "devices for personalization and customization that incorporate or utilize a wearable system of the user," said John Rizzi of U.S.P.T.


While it seems unlikely we could have envisioned all these new, "personalized" and "smart-friendly" applications coming about, some of the patents were filed for just such purposes -- or are simply the latest inventions to spring up. One application covers a wireless wearable tracking bracelet and other devices which can automatically determine what devices your watch has picked up and automatically send messages back when it picks them up to friends who are in an unfamiliar place -- all within the privacy of an app and even on a nearby table at lunchtime, with or without you knowing! (And in a case in point of fact: it uses GPS in order to find and locate nearby friends to pick you up at home to drop you off for your coffee in an unfamiliar area.) Another, published a while back in 2012 in Europe's Patent and Trademarks Agency (Patft), was to develop and build an "electrical wireless communication device." And just as the "personalized wrist watch" described earlier today might soon include some form of a GPS unit embedded on top of a phone and some form of smart lock function that is able to keep it all in your hands for when a car gets to be at least 30 feet behind your neck and that could then tell when you have entered that new neighborhood -- one could very likely be working on the concept of "smart wearables."


One particularly notable application that's not related to anything new that came before has the U.S.P.T.'ing patent to build and use the GPS tracking functionality built into wearable tech to keep you on track to a location in order that you could have more convenient and easy access to a destination if your location is being used, such as the gym for running, swimming, walking or riding your bicycle. That application seems quite specific enough as a device, as far as GPS is concerned to cover this application's idea and
