PROMPT :
If youâ€™re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza thatâ€™s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as youâ€™re gonna get at home.

COMPLETION : 


In the meantimeâ€¦ let's make some of the dough, right away:

Here is one way you might make a quick bread-making batchâ€¦ if that doesn't quite look as pretty:


This one might even work. Here is one of my own recipes (see my video):


The first step to making bread, dough or whatever is just cutting your slices off the bread-maker (see photos on my YouTube videos on how to use one). Here's another recipe I created with that tool, one you should give a go:

Once the dough comes to a smooth doughnut shape (I call these thick rolls doughs in the photo) you simply dip the slices (if there is enough on the end for your recipe) in the hot oven air-tape mixture to form them:


This way when they come into the hot air-tight containers and set down for a quick cooling (about 20 mins or more depending how cold or how wet they look in a container with them!)â€¦ they come to rest right in those containers! (See photos above for detailsâ€¦) I also make thin slices that sit inside those plastic containers while I heat them and cool the pizza on low and fast on low until itÃ­s cooled, then remove the plastic container from the oven to get all your pizza out for serving and reheat:

For a nice crisp, chewy texture while the toppings cook â€“ and when everything's melted (this happens about 50 to 60 minutes after they come out from their oven â€“ about 5 more mins after that, depending how dry and dry-oily their pizzas turn out) you might as well do this and take one or both thin strips at a time:


Then it just needs cooling until cool to handle â€“ which, since they donÃ­t melt very well in a skillet when I use a cast iron pan with low, steady heat, is about a 10 to 20 mins:


After about 30mins or so they come together pretty easily (just flip them to one side, add your topping or a dollop of butterâ€¦ if they need toppings then toss a little cheese to the pan so that there arenâ€ªt a ton left overâ€¦) â€“ then, to serve! The only trick here is to cook for 20 or 25 seconds more to get everything in place, just to really heat them up to make a thick doughnut texture on your own or for something slightly drizzly, which you could try as wellâ€¦ just take your thin strips and toss with cheese until they have nice and well spread apart:

I use this pizza dough (not all that often because we eat a whole lot) on the pizza rolls or when serving it at the table or anywhere elseâ€¦ because this makes perfect thin-dusted pizza â€“ as easy or even more tasty and cheesy and satisfying as I get at home ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚ It takes less work to prepare the crust or roll, and makes a perfect snack (or, better still, lunch)!

What does the pizza crust look like, then? This pizza, I can honestly tell you that!

There is some very thick cheese and mozzarella in that thick layer and on that roll and all that delicious dough you've got. You've probably also got your slices ready when I get them into this pan so I just add it to one or all three pan sides as they sit on that cooling and ready, but don't worry: if you are not serving your crusts that day â€“ which is not often I find myself â€“ the rest are going in this one and the top 2 or three will stay inside their respective containers:


It can even freeze very quickly once chilled in the pan â€“ I just reheated it after 15 minutes and let them rest for at least a week. When we did reheated pizzas they would last 3 monthsâ€¦

Now it's time to serve it ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚ (
