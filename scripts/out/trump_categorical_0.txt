COMPLETION : 


Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States on November 4, 1976. On hearing the news of his presidency, Reagan gave a news conference to announce that he was resigning in a highly emotional speech at the White House.

Reagan, born Edgar Gaebel in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1897, was born to wealthy German industrialist-muse, Norbert André Reagan, and his wife and beloved daughter, Rose Leaf Reagan. The youth of the family rose through the ranks of the Frankfurt School, from being bankers and upper-class housewives to leading in the world of publishing, and when he was 34, became the youngest oil tycoon in history, doing money business with the Soviet city of Yazd during the Civil War.

Reagan began his career in the development business as an initial investment banker and wasn't shy about displaying his wealth picking political targets like Fidel Castro during the Sandinistas' hunger strike.

Realizing political power came more easily with a shower of money than with sticking it out grade-school teaching with teacher's certificates, Reagan became a stallion in the government purse and punched his predecessor in the mouth with the $30 million Treasury bill he printed after having gotten the money in his first budget. Reagan was one of the first Trump supporters who said he could not endorse him, though it's hard to tell him you shut up and resisted the weakened Rebublican when Hoover dropped a field agent who was protesting the separation of church and state dramatically. Trump, who turned over his tens of millions of hard-earned voter turnout dollars to Republican groups including the Republican National Committee, per miserable morning TV moment, hacked off Bush's microphone prematurely and delighted in a soundbyte decayizing talk of tax one-hit buy Hilla Trump was unusually defensive about bringing the "ugly."

The Reagan home in Valuesville, Nebraska. On June 10, 1980, the white elephant had been relocated to Leesburg, Virginia where Karl Rove, the director of George W. Bush's presidential campaign and his son George H.W. Bush's former chief of staff, was living. Enemado's house is now the Reagans, pictured above and flying in from Japan. Once in G.W. Bush's life, the Reagans attended the house as regulars, driving the stubborn dresser around in their Mercedes 647s. In particular, Aspen also likes to get used to the Trump legal attention, having been called a free speech acolyte in one interview. (California heads lots of properties in California, too.) On June 17, 1986, Underwoods as president at one point bonding with Mrs. Reagan in a presidential mansion, it was noted by People magazine and a descendant described, "There will never be another Aspen Bush, claiming that Peter Enemado weighs more than 14,000 pounds or as in Limp Bizkit five people, no more than that." Other Aspen or Patton yards have pictures (imrelated to their ages) of Aspen running around with Never-Never Guy swinging, waves, playing in the ocean or two? flashes of light coming from Louis XV…The poll shows that all look the same from the front. California, apolitical. Californian, also apolitical.
