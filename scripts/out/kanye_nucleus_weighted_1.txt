PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 
 Kanye released his first studio album Yeezus two months later in March 2014 with the help of his YEEZUS Entertainment Group. The title was subsequently used to label West's upcoming second project The Life of Pablo ‹ a collection of his own lyrics as well as collaborations and rarities released this June‹ in honor of his 70th birthday. It's been five full albums in total that the album will mark as far as he is concerned, a milestone he has never seen in terms of longevity or popularity in music. Kanye and Yeezus are part of his "KANYE WEEK" tour, a three day trip he'll kick-off in September through his hometowns and the US and Mexico to promote his upcoming debut project The Life Of Pablo in June and then perform the record across America and Canada at the start and ending of September, which also coincides with The Weeknd›'s second U.K. performance on The Weeknd› tour. West began to reveal some information to us on Sunday. It will take Kanye four to five albums before YEEZUS reaches release. We don‰t have any further information until Kanye is released with it on September 7, he will share further updates later. On Thursday evening Kanye shared this teaser from Jesus, with Kanye‡s official announcement expected on June 27th at a special concert that has also featured a handful of notable guest spots and other celebrity guests like Kanye, Lady Gaga‡ and Justin Bieber ‐ as well as the likes of The Weeknd and Rihanna †, the former of which appeared at The Last Fucking Time festival at Madison Square Garden with the rest of her collaborators last December.

In other words Kanye† is releasing music this year with the aim to get back into a rhythm as the years move on and as we become increasingly aware that his next two solo efforts aren‰t likely to arrive soon or be completed by any meaningful period, at a reasonable amount of time and as part of an expansive plan. That said, I hope you understand that if Kanye released another single after The Weeknd's performance in Manchester in early May and if his new music wasnít quite ready when YEEZUS arrived we'd see another set of speculation surrounding West releasing some sort of new YEEZUS album ‹ even though it might still have to wait. Kanye, like the entire creative world that is West's universe ‰ we would rather hear nothing and just believe that whatever comes from your mouth has some significance to something. You never know what Kanye means for a release of Yeezus to do. So stay tuned. I canít wait to see what Kanye† has cooked up, I can feel it inside my head already ‪#‰<|endoftext|>This morning on "Happened" I shared with the listeners my experiences and insights on this issue from several different sources (especially with Drs. David Schnau and David Biernat and others that have written for "HAPPED"), with an additional article coming later in this post. In response, one reader said to me:

My mother asked for some kind of a statement on "honey." I am very curious how we as a society will handle this? The fact that I cannot think about what a man needs is so frustrating for my husband! This needs a serious re-examination! He has no right! He wants his man to look better than he can in all this makeup stuff and his makeup is getting in the way and he can feel that, because there's this thing called a beard on the inside that you don't see very often and then the makeup makes things appear so much darker and less attractive on that outside. He said he had tried every method and there were no ways. But this woman has told my father in a meeting, this is just so hard for me that we would love him so badly but I do feel a lot
