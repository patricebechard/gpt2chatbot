PROMPT :
If you’re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza that’s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as you’re gonna get at home.

COMPLETION : 


I have been making pizza dough over the past 3 years and I think I just hit on the "craziest" way ever to make a low carb pizza. This pizza dough doesn’t contain wheat flour or wheat starch, unlike the "wontons" and cream cheese that you are likely to find in many traditional pizza doughs. So I am able to make an incredibly thin, light crust pizza that tastes so much better than your average flourless pizza dough with it's dense texture.

What are you going to tell your friends that have never tried making a low carb pizza?

I started by using my favorite nonstick baking sheets since they're lightweight and the dough sticks to them better than store-bought baking sheets. You can buy these cheap at the dollar store or at your local home goods store.

Now, you must heat the dough until it is done cooking. As you can see from the picture above, I'm not using enough heat to make it cook to its natural, golden brown color. But, just like my regular wheat flour pizza dough, the thickness was perfect.

And, just like any good thin crust pizza, it's going to keep in a dry and cool place for around 12 to 16 hours in the fridge or in the freezer at room temperature.

Once the dough has finished cooking, remove the dough from the oven and let it sit for 5 minutes (as shown above) to cool down and firm up. (If you're using a regular baking sheet you will be able to use this time for even longer). When it cools down remove it from the oven and let it sit for a few minutes after cooling (like the picture below).

After about 30 minutes (or 1-2 hours, depending on the temperature) of letting the dough rest, cut out the cheese (if using, just chop the cheese to size. You are not going to need the entire dough) and place it back in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. (This may take longer or less depending on the thickness and the temperature of your dough)

In a medium bowl combine your remaining 1/2 cup of your favorite non-dairy cheese and 1 tsp of melted butter. You'll want to whisk or whisk in the melted cheese mixture to form a paste.

Now, you're ready to assemble the dough.

Place your thin crust dough into a large bowl and cover with a damp kitchen towel. This lets it rise and expand, which makes it easier to roll out and to remove from the oven once you're done baking the dough.

Now, add some of your favorite toppings (candy, shredded cheese, fresh herbs, etc.).

Bake this dough for 12 minutes. You will know when baking is done when the cheese forms a very slight lumps in the center of the cheese, and you see a little white liquid coming out of it.

Remove from the heat and allow the crust to cool on the baking sheets and let it rest for 6 minutes. (The dough is ready when the edges of the dough come away from the sides of the sheet).

After the dough has rested, fold in the last 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture to form a nice crumb.

Repeat your steps in order to finish the recipe. Your pizza dough is now ready to assemble!

As a reminder the bread is pretty much the same if you're using flourless. So be careful with the toppings as many will melt when you slice.
