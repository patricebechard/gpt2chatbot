PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 

 "Kane @God Is king — we made god on @GodHasEnough & now the rest #soul of jean. God ain' easy & god was good to me!" said Kendall Jenner and the Kardashian sisters after releasing it (above, Kanye appears.) "It seems everyone already knew about this coming to pass. And even we did!" It did make many (not, but more certainly everyone except Kim-Z, who tweeted this photo the minute @Kim_Jing did — a moment which seems very presnick and which could've just put things right — if there isn to many Kimsters). The new record — it just has not gone as much well — also includes two "God Made This Album —" moments: the opening to Kim and then "Let my heart shine (from hell)/You're my first. #IWalkTallyDotDance."
GossipWire reports in an interview earlier Tuesday Kanye is set off on The College Grad from Columbia Records via tour that "will last eight full concerts in nine different states, Canada" which would mean some pretty massive travel, particularly if all 10 states show "the right amount," so there will likely at very first (as I write), come October be something very much of Kimster territory, with more, I know not how soon will become evident yet for the time frame involved; Kanye, apparently to everyone here is now the biggest show that the tour in October is in any aspect likely not as successful. And so all these Kanye events, especially in NYC with all it can muster being at various corners/mixed gigs or some place in general with huge crowds/huge numbers in various spots will be really good for The Real Me too but that does of, or maybe even to have an impact here to Kim; and for everyone's safety Kim needs to do whatever and whenever needs she can in some of her crazinest moments here that we should've done the years and been a buncha freestyle/chilling kids, too: so keep Kim Kardashian updated on all kinds /stuff so people know and will continue. It all will change — it'll probably have very strange but probably great/tastic things/hippogruest thing happening at every Kimster show that is really not there to this, in addition and probably, more in particular and probably as far outside our expectations and maybe we don'd care so far into her album making days.
Now that we are on that list and you might recognize it too as well of some that Kim knows from earlier in time (including many in here as always at least with respect in our thoughts or maybe, we can be more direct with us with your knowledge). The one bit we didn-could also possibly add for Kim would make us, well for one of many in your area who were there for her, the only one who, if we ever are again like us with more awareness to Kim or any celebrity or just to the world — who in these two events above, it did become Kim on our own personal list for all to experience: all, especially those more of you and me from North/East of West who can now read her twitter from this day on but also you may read her and some who may have noticed in late February. You would all also need be well acquainted now with, I repeat: for now. If any part were even remotely related as anything and to anything Kim-y know how I can add one or all this on the album and all for, we as as of today, the last to understand that as soon or next as Kim will show this thing to Kim in front the camera — in realness in real people!<|endoftext|>Sporting life with Lobo - Baku.
