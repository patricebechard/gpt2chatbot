PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 And he can return whenever the Lakers do get it right, like the 2015 season was right here at the Garden.<|endoftext|>This week saw another big milestone for Google: it reached 1.4 billion users with Google's own app, which will now serve all sorts of information, not to mention its own news aggregation service called Android Market, among a multitude of other things, like Google's search and voice service Google Hangout (also with Google Now), search services that provide search by default and voice recognition to control the Google Home. In fact, in today's post we talked more about Google Now (see the previous update on why today is so great, too, as we also get ready for Google Play Games to finally be released) but the new features for Google Search have a very strong focus: the Google Search feature allows developers and service providers to build new applications with new capabilities. In this blogpost you can check out how they are making it easy to make your Android application do anything in Search with new Search functionality, from simple search queries, to interactive results and other search types to even advanced features such as the Google search app that brings up an additional set of contextual results from any web or web API you have provided for it, including from your application (or Google Cloud or any service you want it to be integrated to, too.) We also have more on Search, including how to get started. In fact, it would have been very hard not to take the above as part of a full post already: the whole concept is incredibly flexible in that Google can integrate Search to your other features such as Android apps that let developers create web experiences using native mobile platforms to build web apps using Google Search to do some basic information and query them. Of course there is another, bigger piece: in addition to Google search integration and all its functionality you should definitely know of the latest update that you can try for Android that adds support to Google Photos and its other photos app: Photo Sphere! As you can see below the new update brings new functionality including Google Photos (with search enabled for Android), and the addition of new Google Photos and the addition of the Photos API, and all these things should make the Photos app look awesome for the Google Assistant or for just being one more place in your phone, as we know Google doesn't always give a complete and complete experience in their Android experience and so adding the additional photo app that will allow it, along with Photos Sphere in your Play store app will make the whole experience even more seamless in Android: the Photo Sphere is built around Google Photos as an integrated solution. That said: you need to read this full update (or, even more of my other posts!) so it does not just serve the same features that have already come out to users through other apps on Play store:

In fact if Google Photos integration with Search wasn't available to you (or if it did, then just add Photo Sphere from other APIs or the web as shown here in your Android Play app in Google search for this one feature to appear for Search results in Google Maps in your mobile browser): it also adds new information (the Photo sphere), to show a few options: you can select from photos in your app: the app or photos (if you use an external application such as Gallery that you install and configure the Search service through). Or: from this search result on any app (and then Google Search) or from your application's web pages or API's API, which include all relevant data and links (which could be useful, e.g., from any Web service to an image search query you have in your Android application for Photos). For example: the option will open up all photos related with that app you selected: it shows photos of the users, of what you are watching or listening on, etc, in the Google Photos application or Photos in other APIs on any Google Play app. And there's the more complicated case with search related photos
