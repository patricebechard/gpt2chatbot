PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

 If this ever occurs, the masses will know who the most famous Lakers' journeyman is.


Bryant said the following:

"I really appreciate all the fans that are behind me. I respect them and I want to do the best I can for them while I'm able, and make them proud by doing everything I can. I just want to say, I hope that I can deliver on something that I've said I'd accomplishing and I'm really excited about it. Just a pride thing, but that's what it's about.
