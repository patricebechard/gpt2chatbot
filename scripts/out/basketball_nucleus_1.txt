PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 He is one of the finest players that have played for any team, not to mention, arguably one of the all time greatest scorers (if you include Magic Johnson, that title belongs to Bryant.

Kobe has always played the "I'll come back whenever, anywhere if…" line in regards to any of this, as well. I would guess most fans feel that this time around Kobe should get an extension or maybe even rejoin his former squad on the road (the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2011 NBA Championship at home with him and Carmelo).

That is my theory for why fans may feel Bryant shouldn't sign a extension: Kobe's team doesn't need him in that regard at this time. That is probably my least favourite part of the Bryant-Jazz relationship to date, so if Kobe really does decide on another deal this off-season, then I expect Kobe to get his come-uppance on July 17th in Philadelphia against his old squad, and to give all Lakers fans that team that game for sure, for as many reasons, I can possibly come up with for him not replaying on July 16th, when his last game against Philadelphia would be (assuming that it happens that day), that the game would go the exact same. If that wasn't the case and the Jazz get their come-up big-man for sure this off-season and if the Mamba decides to join them this time round then Kobe and the team will not have been treated quite as fair since that last game back at home last season and in the 2012 NBA Playoffs against Dallas. This may seem petty of a statement considering the situation for most, I'm not even sure how I should even speak about a "come back if", especially to someone whose entire team, especially his starting group has only been together a full three full seasons and have played every single season and playoff since 2011 and who hasn't seen a full season in his entire NBA career since 2002/2003 with the Dallas Mavericks, so for my taste it isn't petty. So with that said…if the team that he's with gets the big contract they could easily afford with their new core of Kevin Love/Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan this offseason I'm guessing Bryant may be interested, because he may get the benefit of another year at full speed on a great team (or if they don't go that far this year he's more willing than the rest of the team and they wouldn't have to make up for any lost year with this one if it isn't that huge and Kobe is healthy, but even a season would help a great player's chances this season). If I may suggest that he also give himself that much better opportunity and maybe make sure he is a key piece of that new team's starting four by going full speed and giving all his new team the ball with this upcoming offseason with a different mindset as the coach this year to give everything possible for the entire new starting five, then it might all make perfect sense as long as this isn't the only new player joining the starting lineup as they enter that "coming back anytime anytime if, ever" phase of a season where he is just getting a chance for another run or even just one game before going to play one of these new guys in a full game with new energy. This way Kobe would know, after one full year he wouldn't even need another one this upcoming off-year to show he could possibly go the distance. If there was no deal on his deal next July I feel Kobe Bryant should be able to play one last time and then give his teammates another chance after July 15th this year before taking a trip with that new group as it takes over his career to get some fresh legs into the new team he plays this next year as it will only take one of Kobe, Griffin, Love, Deandre Jordan to do and all that could mean for this year. The best scenario that could possibly unfold is this
