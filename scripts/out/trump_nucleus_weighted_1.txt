PROMPT :
Donald Trump will resign the presidency in 2019 in exchange for immunity for him and his family, former Bush adviser says.

COMPLETION : 
 The White House is refusing to accept Mr. Trump's apology." The Trump Administration would be a laughingstock in Washington without President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both of whom were deeply involved with the transition efforts. But Trump can expect a lot in his departure as it has never come at any great price to any one party, which would explain Mr. Trump's refusal to publicly commit that the nation will honor his pledge that America won't seek any political retribution or punishment. President Obama had his first official trip overseas and met the president of Egypt with whom Trump would be dealing on many important bilateral topics, which was also part of his commitment. This week Trump was expected to speak on behalf of Russia and to have meetings with Putin at their respective foreign countries to try and find the way out of Syria and Iran-both of whom had nuclear weapons in 2015 when Russia began their destabilization in Ukraine. On Monday morning a top official for Russia in the U.K. wrote the president that President Donald Trump is looking into the prospect that Putin may not have done what his allies want to him in Ukraine.

On Friday it was reported Trump may decide on whether the country has "full flexibility" as far as how long to keep the nuclear option, an Obama policy. A U.K. source told ABC that while the administration still does not rule that in the interim President Barack Obama must not seek an increase in the United States nuclear weapons. President George H. W. Bush was known as the greatest man and most accomplished President on the face of this earth who was the greatest leader I ever knew but never knew in his whole lifetime and he did something in Afghanistan, a major military accomplishment that I believe has done the most to reduce that nation to poverty. It had saved a bunch of people's lives there for 20-30 years but now is just not a place anymore for the Americans and our soldiers in that region because there is no military threat. But he didn't know there wasn't anymore to deal with so when he did his first trip and visited, they went back there to look around, it wasn't great for that region of Africa that was there. In fact, you're in an environment with a lot of terrorism now and they're still getting their stuff in that environment that has done great. We have no more boots on ground there than there were back when Obama did this, we just have different numbers now than when we left back when we took office. The only other thing they did that did that great, that really worked back in 2005 was that he got Iran out and I think, they would have got much better and maybe gotten to their end, I'm just saying that that had some lasting value in terms of our engagement there because that helped us build relationships across those borders with some great states. In fact I can just see now with Donald Trump there is no difference, if there were that it wouldn't be great but when President Trump did his visit I think he felt more strongly on those borders as we were going into that and it wasn't because that we wanted some of what that had. There had always been great respect but I feel with some people now they just haven't come around to this notion of America's responsibility in a region like Afghanistan because if they hadn't been so successful, there might never been so many problems across Afghanistan and in Afghanistan it's now more a matter of survival and that's been one thing we can look forward with great confidence now for 20 more years as long as America does not engage that country, and I believe, if he was looking, there were discussions over whether they wanted the nuclear option, we were still looking into that. But you see there was great support among his friends around, you see that there have always been a number of Republican people on the Hill that have worked hard in his campaign. There was never this sense he had some deep problem about nuclear power that had come to him but he really wanted
