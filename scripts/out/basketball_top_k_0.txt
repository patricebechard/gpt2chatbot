PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 They may ask about Pau; he would look absolutely hideous but, like most players who can take up 30 and 41 NBA career hours every weekend when training sessions, there was probably less room and Kobe took too far on this team during camp for his team at UCLA to make his job safer by leaving after he scored 38 point.


Lemaire of Wailuth (MV): He was one step slower on Thursday than Saturday; maybe more like 20 or less for Sunday and Sunday before it ended for no obvious fault he felt as it played it down a bit to Sunday to Monday. He'll still probably feel very strong and strong. A couple minutes later when Coach Fisher walked his team across, this man had one word (that came a third way), that you will recall only from when L-Man Kobe used to throw tantries: You do something! Now that would take guts in an honest-faced way and maybe there had had, as there would still exist enough on hand when there could possibly want or require more to go round up some real NBA team to try a rebuild in terms for him returning: a rebuilding draft? Well let those words pass with ease until we move in to Friday at 1 or so PM in the East: who does it look? How's there not something happening yet as you move in here from the Northeast as well or, let these rumors go with the wind in our general consensus (with us believing this one was based only in our personal opinions? Just for context), I want something as much of our NBA, for Kobe at times to just be gone; to return here when and to be sure; this isn 'Bounce' or this was just something I can not see him ever making a mistake; just leave the last year in town as his? That sounds to an untouchably like what a few, many folks would tell anyone at work to the effect in a nonstop state the best is in it to do all it wants when someone wants all to take his back: "you have done something right there you didn and just got out", if nothing of any great, lasting worth, because in fact there was so good it might just matter enough at that given circumstances when it happened, as it can matter so far down at a mere 15 or fewer minutes or if you were a good teammate but not great enough, what else is possible for him but for someone not yet proven the NBA as well at their position in a great world (i'd prefer someone more of 'the Lakers and it doesn''i know Kobe was told at that very thing but I feel it will get talked back) to stay with his best in those 15 plus or a fair portion for an 18th or if there still may prove, this man in LA said after Friday (a team day of one thing? That he'll only get in, and if, how he might or not find an ending after he returns as it has for several NBA franchises and some professional ones); as someone not too proud or very outspoken yet and for who needs not.<|endoftext|>From Wikipedia we go no farther (if there truly existed any way, at our very site is still "an area around us"), because I did that thing of having several hundred or whatever-nearly four months and hundreds just written in. We have to get a job; some will say jobs get a long rest period so I might have better start one for "now I am working. "

 for it; one does. So we might do something at our site; you just think, now we shall. Anyway a long period seems more useful and a shorter but also very effective one for a site is more or otherwise "just in case there happens, the possibility exists at any one in this world when this, the "world", or it will actually turn back on some people/a planet in "the" current world. We should start writing the stories of these times as far they have
