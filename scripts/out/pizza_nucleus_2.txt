PROMPT :
If you’re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza that’s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as you’re gonna get at home.

COMPLETION : 
 This homemade homemade thin crust crust will make your kitchen smell delicious! (But be sure and keep an eye out because when the weather starts cooling you will know what the problem was‫!) I‰ve done so much testing and research about using this dough (in terms of dough, time required to rise to the correct temperature) on homemade pizza and other food based recipes in this book (like these pizza dough baking instructions for a gluten free pie, a pizza sauce and tomato sauces). I have made my dough for many times on these pies so that my readers know to go into my shop to make my recipes in order, if your dough does NOT follow your dough instructions. So be warned when buying a homemade crust or baking a batch. Be VERY aware if your crusts come with an odd consistency because this recipe has to be rolled onto a baking pan with no flour for rise or even just for cooking, and then kneaded again on top. And then you'll want a very long rise for even rise consistency (that dough should never get soggy), which can vary quite dramatically on different recipes so always check.

When to Use It


The time when my pizza crust dough is ready is when I let my kids (4-5 of them!) know that we've been eating a meal, but it‣s cold. You will get the hang of baking my dough right before we get the first warm dinner, when I don't even have an oven. Once they are up, you are on to baking!


This pizza dough makes 2 layers – dough for 2 and baking powder/glaze for a final 1″ of the crust on each sheet (you will also notice there are a little flour slumps for my homemade homemade tomato sauces on the sheets that don't rise to rise. If the first batch of pizza dough you make isn't a hit on you and is soggy (see photo below) and there are more sogginess to the sauce after you start rolling the baking paper, please take a break, bake up another layer and see where your pizza is right on from this step (if the second batch is too sticky then you could probably use this pizza sauce). The next time you are up, you will need a slightly longer (8 inches to 10-11 inch long) sheet and roll to get all of the layers on the surface and you can now turn it onto the pan that I preheated your pizza crust dough in before starting on the last layers in your oven and preheat. You will know it is ready when it comes off your oven (no sogginess is noticeable as a matter of course), it has started to set up in your pan (this happens faster at my shops so I'm trying my very best) and a couple of minutes later your dough is done for you. I've learned that the most effective technique in cooking with dough is not the baking process itself.

You could try adding an egg yolk and some cream on your top to get that creamy consistency on top, you will have to try some different toppings but my secret for making sure I make this right is a good thing because sometimes when it starts to become too dry and sticky my hands become irritated, so when that occurs to your oven the oven timer doesn‣t reset because it does this for each crust separately to make sure they get it exactly the way they need‡ so that means no need to wait, but it helps keep you from doing some nasty stuff and it makes for quick cleanup on those big day-night cleanup times. The other way I make my homemade homemade thin crust pizza (as the crusts are made into thin sheets by the dough roll on a sheet then rolled into 1-inch thick patties for easy storage in my kitchen storage unit), you would bake this in a hot, draft proof pan then turn into thin rolls by the sheet.
