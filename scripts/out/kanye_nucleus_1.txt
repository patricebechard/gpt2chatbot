PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 
 Kanye himself appeared briefly with Kim and appeared as the title and the project was revealed as his. The song was reportedly supposed to come in September 2013 but is now rumored to come on July 14. Kanye tweeted that Kanye was making it for a long overdue Christmas special in early 2013, and he even teased an early date. The post has since disappeared from Kardashian's account.


"Christmas Is Coming Soon. I'm Going Home Tonight. I Want A Holiday Gift To Send You This Week!" — @Kardashian — #KimAndKanye (@kanyewestmusic) October 15, 2012


Kim posted on Thursday a screenshot from the upcoming Christmas Special:


The title for Kim's project sounds promising for its inclusion in an early holiday gift. In a new photo, it can be seen as a Christmas present:


Kim's tweet and photo suggest an April 2014 Christmas release. While Kim hasn't commented directly, we suspect her project could arrive this week in January 2014 as well. This wouldn't necessarily make Jesus, My Christmas is Upon You one of her first Christmas records since 2014 but could mean Kim may be looking towards a full Christmas set-list from Kanye that features "The Life of Pablo," which she produced along with her collaborator Draymond Green on 2013's Cruel Winter and 2016's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album. If Jesus and Kanye have already had an extended Christmas tour since then it would put them at their best holiday-based songs this Christmas, since both songs were nominated at this year's Billboard awards and nominated at this year's Billboard awards for album of the year (the song also came on last year's VMA nominations album), though they didn't appear on either year's top 25 songs. In an August 2012 profile, Draymond Green told MTV: "If God had not allowed [Jesus' release date], this whole Jesus project might not exist." It will likely also mark another step into 2014.

Those are some pretty accurate and accurate descriptions that are frequently uttered at a recent news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, when pressed by an international conference organizer about their response in recent months when the Islamic State militants, also called ISIL or Daash or ISIL-Iraq or Daesh in other regions of the world, claimed significant losses on their soil, with some Canadian and Western intelligence reporting, the attacks in the two places claimed in March this year, were indeed acts of terrorism perpetrated against Westerners. It seems they were, but this has all the ring of facticity.


I think we should all take note of how often we get wrong about such matters, in Canada. In our media there are few and few, when it comes to news coverage on terrorism, we are the most gullible. That may well reflect in how well people think Canadians actually do in matters related to terrorist activities in this country – or how easily their perception can change if it so desired – or even that people, especially our political leadership, will do something about that perception, given who's on their minds right at this point, in their opinion or otherwise. So the more that the news coverage gets, however well intentioned it seems to us to do, we will find we can have some trouble with some facts, but when those facts are, by any standard of reliability or credibility – when our perception can easily shift when facts that have not even reached the most skeptical among us turn into a very public one when our leaders want us to take an objective position – that is not the place in our democratic system. So while Canadians will probably think their leadership knows a great deal better when they are doing these interviews, what I will say is the truth of that – in the news
