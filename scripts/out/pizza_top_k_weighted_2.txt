PROMPT :
If you’re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza that’s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as you’re gonna get at home.

I like to cook everything hot for at least one hour. So let's get started!

For The Perfect Thin crust Pizza Dough

For a thin crust, the dough must be completely dry and the crust's bottom crust should completely cover the bottom of the pizza itself. If you bake the pizza in the oven, you could potentially get a really thin crust with no crust on top and not much meat!

To create those ultra-thin crust pizza dough, you're gonna need four things:

Bread - If you've ever made a thin crust pizza dough, you'll know that the bread used is very critical in creating a thin crust. And since we're only looking at one slice, that's no big deal. So, for bread to be tender and moist for the dough to hold together, you're gonna need the right type of bread.

Pizza Sauce - If you've ever made a thin crust pizza dough, you'll know that I make use of a homemade pizza sauce that I use when making pizzas. If you've ever made pizza sauce before, you know how awesome it is. So, my sauce is actually a great substitute for the cheese I typically use. And, if you happen to cook in the oven before making my pizza sauce—no big deal—that's fine! Just add in your own homemade sauce and you're good to go for the dough.

Pizza Powder - The key to making a really great pizza crust is to use as little as possible. For that reason, I don't typically use any pizza powder, although I do use it when making bread dough. In fact, I would even give away a little at a time for your friends and family. And, if you are a pizza baker, that extra bit could save you a whole bunch of money!

Pizza Dough Starter - I always keep a batch of my pizza dough in the back of my refrigerator on the way to work (because I need to be sure it's ready before the next day, so that I can move it into the oven). Now, you'll never have any issues with your first batch getting wet when trying to move it into the oven (it really doesn't matter to me.)

My Pizza Baking Soda

Now that you've got a recipe that you can actually work with, it's time to get to work and start baking.

Here's how my crust dough looked when I baked each pizza:

The thickness of my crust dough came out like the photo on the left. The bread, which is pretty flat on the inside is almost a perfect thickness.

How to Make Amazing Pizza Baking Soda

It takes some creativity to make the perfect pizza baking soda! And this is where I find my own inspiration when starting. First, let me tell you why your pizza baking soda needs to be very thick (which I don't believe will matter in this recipe—that's right: just add your own soda to the pizza!) The reason is that pizza dough must be very dry before being completely dry and if it becomes too dry, the meat will begin to get crispy from the excess water they use to bake the pizza. By baking for a relatively short time in the oven, the extra water creates extra moisture in the oven that will help your pizza dough to stay moist when it gets to the pizzerias.

In order to make these pizza crust pizza toppings stay moist, it requires very good pizza dough. But if you want those extra toppings on your pizza, it'll require a little more time in the oven but it's worth it.

So, how do we make it happen?
