PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye West’s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 


While Kanye West has always been known to tease the future with vague titles, it appeared to suggest the project was still in development. While a lot of speculation has been centered around Kanye West taking on the title for his new project, what's even more intriguing was the leak of a title from an unknown artist. After all, the title is actually the only clue in this leak.

A number of theories exist surrounding Kanye West's album. Many of them are more interesting than others, but many of them are equally interesting. Kanye West has already teased in interviews about the project in the past. It was reported that Kanye could release his project within weeks. The leaked tracklist did seem vague, but it was also stated that Kanye West would be working with a different production team in the production. As of now, it remains unknown if Kanye West would be collaborating with the same team or if he would have his own producers. The music itself may also be something Kanye West's team may have worked on.

Kanye West's recent album Yeezus was met with mixed reviews. However, his recent tour with Yeezus is already a huge sell. The album is currently in the top 20 on Billboard's Official Albums chart.

A few other theories have been posited as well. A Kanye West inspired Kanye Duck video surfaced online. A video of rapper A$AP Rocky featuring Yeezus appeared online. A post in Yeezus' Facebook post has been viewed thousands of times and has garnered thousands of likes. The most interesting part of the post is the name Kanye West. The post features a photo of a bird's nest that is apparently a reference to Ye.

The final question still remains to be answered. The title Yeezus is only a placeholder title. Whether it is Kanye West or someone else, what song will be produced by Kanye West during the album's lifespan and when do you think Kanye West's project will be complete?<|endoftext|>Cristiano Ronaldo (right) won two Ballon d'Or awards as Portugal beat Holland in the final of Euro 2016.

Cristiano Ronaldo has won two Ballon d'Or awards following Portugal's defeat to Holland.

The Portuguese superstar netted the winning goals in the final game of Euro 2016 for a world record fourth time.

Ronaldo, 25, made it four times as Portugal won after a 4-0 victory in Rotterdam on Tuesday night, with the match all but over at the end of the 60 minutes as Netherlands took the lead through Nani.

Ronaldo, who won the award a year ago, said: "It was a good victory at home. This is an incredible achievement and I'll celebrate this, as many other Ballon d'Or awards will do, but I will also enjoy it the best. I really appreciate it."

It is the second Ballon d'Or to Ronaldo, who won the trophy in 2010, after his second season at Real Madrid.

The striker scored three of Holland's goals, with Portugal's strike partnership of André Gomes - who made 28 league appearances for the Dutch last season - and Rui Patricio making the key saves.

Ronaldo was not to be denied, with the Portuguese striker making the second of two crucial saves in the penalty area and then heading home his second to give Portugal a 1-0 victory.

It is not the Portugal captain's first World Cup trophy but his second at an international tournament where he led Portugal to their third World Cup victory. The 2009 World Cup semi-final win over South Korea was Portugal's second.

"After a difficult start, Portugal did well," said Portugal coach João Ha
