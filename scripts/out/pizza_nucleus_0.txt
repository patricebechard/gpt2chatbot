PROMPT :
If you’re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza that’s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as you’re gonna get at home.

COMPLETION : 



This homemade crust recipe uses a lot less oil (and a few grams per cup, depending on the sauce you add). Plus it has some fantastic crust qualities and flavor notes you'd love! So you don‒t miss the bread or toppings when you make this crust recipe at home and then go out with that crusty crusty friend and get out all his pizza-making tools for the day! And now that you can easily mix everything together from start-to-finish (the dough gets super simple right there!) it is great to make when the crust doesnít hold your dough too tightly for hours, because once it gets all dough together in just 5 mins or less that means you have more room in your kitchen (because of course the sauce gets super sticky).


Now itíll look sooo nice on that crust pizza at work that‧we could have this for all to sit on a big table all the time (unless the other side of this pizza crust isnít so good)…‭‭ †.


But what is pizza making? It is not about getting something fancy, and if your crust was going to look fancy or something like this…then it shouldn´t have had a crust recipe included in the video at all‬—because then everyone else‰ wouldn´t get it. That is why when people talk to you about getting the most "professional looking crust," or if it has "the perfect cheese…and pizza"… it needs a really cool looking recipe‬(especially if your cheese and pizza don't even go well together! But the cheese does!)—just keep going back to my earlier point of why crust making isn´t so important at this level in terms of making great pizzas‰. It does NOT make for better or more satisfying food or anything‫ so it isn´t for everyone‪

And of course when we talk pizza it needs the best ingredients for crust dough in existence! The BEST thing is to just let it come and sit in there and not worry if there is not any air. There should be no air on it (which you should get a little nervous about)‪

But now letís take it all down‪‭ (except for the air, because I swear the crust should actually feel more at home inside that pizza maker when its really cool like I have.)‬ And let's talk the best pizza recipe! The most famous pizza crust recipe you probably never hear about and even though there were plenty of those over in my old college pizza class in the days, ″when we went on that tour we were never invited to the home baking club anymore‫

But I know thereís not an airless dough pizza you don´t love because that crust crust recipe has been my best crust for ages‪(because you need air, that crust has a good air quality in your hands that is essential when using oil and other toppings to get great bread)

It works, so why‡†? And you will also have an incredible, super smooth pizza and even with it all oil on you could go days,‫ if only I made this in an air-proof oven so there isnít much chance for the bread to stick‪, so I know when this dough recipe starts getting to your head and it really can´t stand to wait and the pizza is so thin. It takes you over two hours. So, when the dough does hold all together the sauce will not only not have a crust, the sauce needs some more flavor notes added that make it seem almost as thick‬ as you might want in pizza crusting.

Plus there should still some cheese, so let that take the cake with a great mozzarella and pepperoni (but also cheese) combo on hand because that crust crusting makes you
