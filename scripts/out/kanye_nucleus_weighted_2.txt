PROMPT :
On Thursday, August 29, Kim Kardashian shared a cryptic post of what appeared to be a title and tracklist for Kanye Westâ€™s forthcoming project. The photo teased a tentative title, Jesus Is King, along with a 12-song tracklist and a release date of September 27. 

COMPLETION : 
 "We'll announce when this comes out." She captioned the pic "God is my sunshine", seemingly confirming an announcement will come from her soon.

However, after some further study into some of this information (such as this video), this has to make its way back down the memory lane (at the end I hope?)

I had just returned home after the weekend, my wife, and my four little boys having finished off the day's festivities, and the family dinner table in their living room, we heard our beloved dog bark for the last time. The last bark he had given, had been about five weeks. I remember how the day would begin in a flurry of emotions for my family, but with him gone, that rush was now quickly turned to deep sorrow and frustration. The dogs have lived through a hell that few, I'd dare call people of a normal or decent moral code, had to face before. For most families that is their only time with the dogs. It was their most basic and sacred time for them to have. And to not do something, something simple for your children was simply unbecoming for you or them as humans and dogs, let alone children. But for our little boy and his little wife (he has now passed, to go be the dad), that is a day of absolute sorrow and despair. The last five days for my two daughters in law, have been the toughest to explain. Our youngest, who I would not have to tell them if asked about it (he will, hopefully). He will still see their father in our room (the one we had to leave so the two kids can spend their holiday together). For two, who I know will always think it would have been nicer not have left their Dad and my wife at our home so suddenly when he got up at 7am, and to find my kids (we both went for the kids' first Christmas) crying so close to us was not even funny at all! (we will go out and spend Christmas with him) but they still want me and his wife, to know the truth! It's really hard and it feels very wrong, as they knew how well that relationship worked before the separation! For a young man in particular (I think I speak from personal experiences now, with how my children reacted) when we leave at such a time when he's on vacation for so many days to get home for them (with a child with us!) you wonder why the hell we did what we did at all? It wasn't a good day and they wanted my daughter, (the little boy who they all look forward to visiting at the holidays for their little boys, who also go back to school), and for all the right reasons for it (because he's still around!), for the right time to bring our home up (a little boy they don't always talk to in person when it's winter here), because their father had been a hard worker on so much and for a very special and beloved boy like him, a Christmas for a child who can see them often! It is something so small to him. The other night they said their last words in their life for the first time to my youngest and said goodbye. We went upstairs (I believe it was in his bed) and had the most special and precious of hugs in our lives and the boys hugged for an instant after saying goodbye and they were very much happy. After my little boy told me this morning I know in that hug the last few minutes they were with us were like their last and last kiss! He also knows the pain in my life that was not his own, for he knows so much. We had all
