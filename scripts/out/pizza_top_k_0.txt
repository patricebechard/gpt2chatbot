PROMPT :
If you’re on the quest for the best homemade pizza dough recipe ever (and pizza!), your search is over. I use some savvy tips and tricks to make an quick and easy thin crust pizza that’s as similar to your fav wood-fired oven pizza as you’re gonna get at home.

COMPLETION : 
 No secret. And really: I do a bunch when the temperature changes… I also make these little squares just by touching a wooden pizza pizza pie maker onto one corner for stability so the wood will glide. These simple dough pizza topping tips have helped us both and helped me learn the value and use more complex pie-dressing recipe recipes, especially these. The pie pizza base will thummpp the entire night on me! It takes an oven only 1 hour but when paired for 10 different types or pies… this bread topping should turn even tastless meat into one of this delicious-ass breadsticks I created, even easier, with your tips and a simple homemade marina shake sauce in place with homemade sour chocolate chip dip!! I make all three (yes! you will get 3 in any 2!) so now, you too might try your hand here 🙂 *this makes 4.88 medium/8oz pizza crust crust! Make 2x 4oz (5/8, 13, 3x 6", 16", etc. – see picture – 2/20 pizza dough). Place 2x bread, in oven-safe muff/pan/cake case. Cook oven and cover in 1 tablespoon coconut milk in 12.1 gallon (330mL+) refrigerator/zerner bag… then turn pan 180˰ until hot to 350 (165 in-flavor level is hot) – do about 2 cups total dough per 8" x 8′ rectangle (~1 hour 15) pizza/gluten. While bread sits in bag & pan – cover it until room temperatures or dough can get in zip locks bag and out freezer if the oven still heats in prehung oven & pizza pizza crust doesn˚n´tm work! After about 3:12, take 1½ cups baking sheet to oven in 15"x17 ¼ x 11 (6× 5) skillet (~4 hrs approx 12) – heat 2- 3 seconds before serving!! Youll need enough heat so if bread stays a bit dry and dough takes time or sits too hot on counter (this isn∞∑Ð¯øÂ° ¶ø Å¨)– put 2ts/sq cup liquid food paste in bag-out until it comes away warm 🙂 Turn parchment side facing out in freezer to dry after baking. Cut 8″X2¥x8 pizza pie to make one crust square (~12" long×18"), bake pizza pie slices side-dazzingly, covered and protected by a small bag, for ~5 mins with rack or plate so dough won‰bounces onto surface and stays even while baked on rack for the pizzazz and topping: let pizzies brown completely! After about 90+ hours and an overnight period when tempers run cool, turn pan off for about 90min then put on cooling stand until chilled before topping & toppying…. you have it: thin layer Pizza Bolognese Bread (you guessed… a full 2″ thin crust! See image), deep red gloop-froggy flavor: 1 ± oz coconut water ½ tbsp (8 cups), honey 5 cloves, fresh crushed cloves 8″ or 18 1st (or larger – about 10 oz or about 150 cups total)* ~16 2½ slices ª to use! A large serving for everyone with 1½ lb for crust. No salt added; or in 1 Tbl olive oils on a frying hot wire pan… if needed.. you will save it. *note– for 4 people using the 3 different slices.
What is The Boca Barley Pizza Recipe?! 🙂 *Note, no I never actually cooked these! Instead of eating them cold – reheared pizzies would always cook like it's been made over – like my friends who made 4 separate pizzis all at home without even cooking these, like some who actually tried to get those in their cropping system but failed because too hot.
