PROMPT :
Donald Trump will resign the presidency in 2019 in exchange for immunity for him and his family, former Bush adviser says.

COMPLETION : 



"It doesn't have any relevance. I'll see," a Trump friend told Bloomberg TV in May 2017, shortly before he had told ABC he might pull the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords (Climate Accords). Trump, he said, had become too dependent on global economic power for success and his supporters didn't have to give it a chance, either. The Trump presidency would then be left in an awkward position: it couldn't simply quit on him (and thus become unviable), and would probably have to find some means by which to avoid his demise, too (the only option left would involve impeachment). Trump might consider the latter course of action before his first week in the job began and consider a resignation or other compromise in lieu of such surrender in mid-March of 2020 — which, again, may have seemed an unimportant consideration.

The Trump presidency will soon come into full force; his presidency may come in full eclipse: He would still have his term; Trump's administration is going through an immense expansion; there is no immediate danger he might lose control over his Cabinet (this has occurred only twice, during Reagan, Nixon and Truman, so there could well be something like four such reversals within four weeks of taking office — with some exceptions), as he has already seen several. In the first weeks and months of his Presidency Trump would be surrounded on two ends — a very dangerous environment — surrounded from all angles from every perspective and from almost everywhere; Trump might feel very lonely there — and if he feels so, this can quickly become unbearable — if Trump loses all control. (Some people in the United States already see this scenario — Trump supporters call this 'The Mad Mad Trump Effect', though I would not go there, and would rather call the phenomenon the Trump Syndrome; for those who want to read my views about 'The Trump Effect,' refer to a few other recent writings that appear online by other scholars of 'the madness and power that is President Trump'.) If a Trump administration can survive Trump, then we'll soon witness another era, an unprecedented and unviable time to have one in human experience. That may sound ominous to those outside this particular world: Trump could well lose everything (the White House staff and the entire presidency itself; all assets) in such a way as to cause enormous damage — as we saw in the Watergate break-ins. Or the United States government — or, if Trump does lose power in a coup (for which Trump will undoubtedly become infamous, for the purposes of political blackmail and/or blackmail) it would probably fail to prevent another global economic catastrophe as well, which will not just threaten to destabilise the world but threaten to collapse and possibly even to end the global civilization altogether (I wrote that scenario here ).

If the United States loses control — and even Trump could become the next president if a coup succeeded and the President is overthrown and his presidency is destroyed (which would not only end in chaos for a long period, but, given Trump's lack of self-regard in a very bad and unending economic situation), this could trigger a nuclear confrontation with North Korea or any other power. This may cause chaos for the rest of humanity — as we saw when North Korea threatened and destroyed Hiroshima on 6 September 1945; it did so under the conditions we all accept and expect to happen during peacetime when power has not been so heavily centralized in any single leader, nor under conditions when, for example, North Korea and China and South Korea could each use all possible diplomatic leverage. A world that loses itself would become less stable (the world has become increasingly dangerous — more than 70 percent more than a quarter century after WWII, since we began recording all this; there would no longer be so many places around the world for a world without chaos — the only possible option is a 'World Order': that would likely end as nuclear warfare began with any one power or even
