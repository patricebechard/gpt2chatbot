PROMPT :
Donald Trump will resign the presidency in 2019 in exchange for immunity for him and his family, former Bush adviser says.

COMPLETION : 
 "We don't know how long he wants to stay," Trump told ABC's Jonathan Karl, "but you can bet that he will resign."

The president said his attorney general will be Trump's pick to replace him.

The retired neurosurgeon said last month he was seriously contemplating stepping down.

While Trump did not name a replacement for him, he did promise he would be "honored to accept the resignation" of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions.

The Senate had a 60-vote threshold to block Trump from serving out his term. That's why, for now, Trump is refusing to resign.

The White House would not immediately comment on the resignation, and the president was "not available" Wednesday morning to the ABC News "Good Morning America" program.

Aides to Sessions have told people close to him that his decision to not seek reelection would probably affect their job prospects during his time in office, including that of his deputy, John Dowd. Dowd had said at a Senate hearing in September that Trump's decision to leave the presidential race would affect his future as attorney general.

The White House also had said Wednesday that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway will remain in the role during Sessions' final months in office.

Sessions' departure from the presidential race would not immediately bring a change in the legal or political landscape in Washington, but it could prompt a recalculation of what a White House has to offer Trump or Republicans in Congress who would hold power for decades beyond 2020.

Trump and his team have spent the past few weeks playing up the prospect of him getting a replacement for Sessions â€” a task that has made him unpopular with the public.

"We're going to need a new attorney general as soon as possible, and it won't be somebody who has had a very good career," Trump told reporters at the White House Wednesday afternoon.

Trump has said he wants a replacement in place by the time he steps down at the end of December.

"What I'm doing right now is I'll be nominating a new attorney general, we'll keep 'em here, and I'll appoint somebody else with the same great heart and the same mind as he would be able to do a phenomenal job," he said last month in Florida. "I am going to make them better. They are going to be better people than anybody ever seen before."

In a recent appearance on ABC News' "Good Morning America," Sessions appeared to back away from that statement, saying: "We're not talking about somebody who won an election. It's the Supreme Court, folks. We're talking about a person who will appoint, I believe, a justice of the peace across the country."

"He's going to have a much better chance of getting his confirmation for what he thinks is right because he has the experience of someone who is going to have the experience in the courts of the United States and in the State Department and the Justice Department of someone who will have the experience in Congress," said Trump's former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has been one of his harshest critics over the years during the campaign. "He's going to have a far better sense of where the people he's trying to reach are than a lawyer in a high position in Washington, D.C. is going to have."

A White House official said Wednesday that Trump still planned to nominate a replacement for Sessions on Jan. 27.

"President Trump has the final say on this," said Trump spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "It's a
