PROMPT :
There is a small but meaningful subset of Los Angeles Lakers fans that wants Kobe Bryant to return to the team. Age be damned, the Mamba mentality is timeless. So long as Bryant walks this Earth, there will be fans begging for him to return to the team.

COMPLETION : 
 That would certainly make the fan experience even better than if it came true with Shaq on board and then he just took his sweet time returning the favor. So we'll find out whether the rumor about Shaq returning as Lakers legend will become reality this season and what kind of player we have once we actually do see Kobe play his next basketball season in LA, whether there is ever any doubt whatsoever on Bryant being on board once more to become Los Angeles Lakers legends forevermore, what it would do with the LA L.A., Laker fandom. It seems we have just entered an era where Kobe will become the greatest player ever. If nothing else we will always have fans of Bryant around us no matter the time frame in which the legend passes. We all remember him for a certain era. He had that famous "I got no fear of no consequences, and if it comes down to the last one" line from "Dope With a Heartbreaker" when Shaq went over and did it again on Kobe and made the Lakers legend's career even shorter because Kobe never did a damn thing that could have caused his departure.<|endoftext|>It has long been said of the American Civil Rights era, which was the year the Supreme Court's decision striking down an unconstitutional Jim Crow ban passed in Brown vs. The Board of Education was delivered, and then came its subsequent and still largely misunderstood ruling against states rights discrimination, "You know how these people feel. The South has been in this situation since the Civil Rights Act passed," said Republican Texas senator Rafael Anchia, speaking during his visit last year to Washington DC's Smithsonian American History Center in celebration of National Day of Historic American Memory. The museum is a national landmark with some 300 pieces on exhibit from both past and modern times including items related to civil rights including civil rights memorabilia.<|endoftext|>In his most famous words since taking up residence as mayor, David Duke of Louisiana is speaking of the "Jewish Mafia". Speaking before hundreds at his church this evening (12.12) and appearing live from an undisclosed address at another in his own church this weekend (19.1/22, see video), Mr Dredvisky spoke to hundreds and asked that their questions addressed only him:

Mr. President. Your remarks today about Israel, as a Christian country and Israel in the Arab World. Are you prepared to talk openly, publicly, in the streets about these questions of what you believe and the consequences for our country in relation to what we've done in these Middle Eastern situations, particularly with these attacks on Israel, particularly by Iran?

Dr. George Washington University Professors,

Dr. Paul Wolfowitz: No, you can talk. No one, including Israel, is going to stop us, the President has been silent on this matter since before his term began in office, so, Dr. Wolfowitz and all these professors from universities across this great Nation will have time in a year, as long as it will give me space. Dr. George, it's the last two questions for today. Mr President, you've spoken publicly a lot about the Jewish problem and I'll follow it with another comment in due course and in this space as a matter of principle I am calling it: Do I agree, is it correct and, Mr President? Are all Christians obligated by faith and tradition and tradition to support our President and his policy as we speak or as the world speaks today regarding Israeli aggression, with all due respect for Mr President.
